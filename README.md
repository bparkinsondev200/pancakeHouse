## 2 ways to run the app

### Take the file ./happyPancakeStack.js and run it with your favorite javascript tester

The file has a function call at the bottom, and a couple variables to run the function to flip and/or generate pancake stacks

### npm start to run the app

select how many stacks you want randomly generated, and then click the button to generate and flip them all!
OR
manually enter a pancake stack with plusses and minuses (ie -+----+-+)
this entry overrides the random generator and no restrictions were set to the input
